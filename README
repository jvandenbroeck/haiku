The goal of this project is to create a one page _art_ piece on the web. Something like the book of mozille (http://www.mozilla.org/book/). 

For now there's only a Haiku on it which get pulled from http://randomhaiku.com and displayed with a nice Google Font, feel free to add other things;
* Lyrics
* Poems
* Quotes
* Wonderfull CSS 

Create something nice!
